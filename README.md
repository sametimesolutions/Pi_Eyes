# Introduction
This is a fork repository from Adafruit PI_Eyes. The eyes.py has been updated to listen for events when motion is detected. The motion sensor should be setup on GPIO 4. When motion is detected a mp3 will be randomly selected from the /boot/music directory. 


# Setup:

1) Follow adafruit instructions to set up raspberry pi: https://learn.adafruit.com/animated-snake-eyes-bonnet-for-raspberry-pi/software-installation
After installation copy eyes.py from the repository to the raspberry pi. 

2) Copy the music folder to /boot/music
